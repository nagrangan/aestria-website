Create a responsive landing page website for d2c ecommerce brand Aestria. 
The brand is a direct to consumer luxury brand, based in the India.
It sells high-quality beautiful charms as in the photos stored in /public/images.
We deliver our items in very high quality kraft packaging. 
some of the product images are in /public/images folder. It can be use for image creations.
The website you create should be minimal, clean, beautiful and elegant. 
It should exude class and luxury. 
There should be generous white space and a layout inspired by high end luxury fashion brands and fragrance houses.
I want you to focus on building the homepage - it should have a clear hero section with a call to action, a section below showing how it works and what you get, a section below with user reviews, a second CTA section, and a footer.
I want the design to have a great aesthetic - don't just give me a single hero feature section followed by a boring two column layout. Really try hard to make it as exciting and unique as possible, while making sure you hit the luxury angleangle
- For copy, come up with a strong message for the call to action buttons. In general, make sure you are using really strong message to help a user convert and check out.
- All graphics is preferably in SVG. Images of products can be in jpg, jpeg, or png.
- Use a thin clean icon set - maybe Lucide icons with a 1.5px stroke width.
- Use react js
- Use a Tailwind style colour palette that uses lots of pastel colors
- For fonts, use Instrument Serif for headings and Space Mono for body copy.
- include a login page when clicking the profile icon at the top.
